# Task1

circles were detected in both images using houghcircles

# Task2

median blur was applied to the image to hide all background noise, until only the card frames were detected by the canny detection, ensuring an accurate contour detection.


a threshold area was set to ignore small contours or bad contours such as uncomplete cards

# Task3

code works fine with most images except frame images
